# Aleksandra Sanecka - Web Developer

## Description
In this project, I created my own homepage where you can find information about the skills I have acquired over the last year of learning JavaScript and a list of things I want to learn in the near future. Feel free to contact me if you need anything ;)

## Technologies used in this project:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Styled-components
- React
- Custom hooks

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
